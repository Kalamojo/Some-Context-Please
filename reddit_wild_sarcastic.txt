Over A million people sign petition calling for KKK to be declared a terrorist group

Totally agree, since we have a unhinged president hell-bent on destroying freedom of speech, we should absolutely give him the power to arbitrarily label groups as "terrorist" /s

I'm not sure why this apparently comes as a surprise to so many Americans, but if you give the government a new power, they're not going to stop at only using it in ways you agree with.

Sure, we could have given Obama the power to arrest people engaging in "hate speech", and perhaps he would have used it to great effect to suppress hate, but guess what Donald Trump would have labeled as "hate speech" on his first day in office? All criticism of him. 

Whether you agree or disagree with any one particular group or message is irrelevant, the question you need to evaluate is if the government should be given the power to police all groups and messages, and I would hope you would realize that that's an awful idea.

His position that the current staffing is fine but he'd be worried if they made more cuts is in itself either stupid or a lie. When Trump's staff took office they also removed the cybersecurity chief position, leaving Bolton in charge of all matters cyber. They were cutting very critical positions left and right, and collapsing special focuses down, just like Mr. Morrison mentions. The blanket dismissal of this move as anything other than dangerous and ill-advised seems pretty silly when you look at the two major concerns for this country during this administration. Cybersecurity and health. 

Why would possibly need experts in that realm informing the POTUS?! /s

* [Has never had an approval rating above 49%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx)

*****
Conservatism (big C) has always had one goal and little c general conservatism is a myth. Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing everyone else down the ladder to create an under class. Secondary to that is a morality based on a person’s status as good or bad rather than their actions. Of course the primary thing that determines if someone is good or bad is whether they inhabit the aristocracy.

This is posted a lot. https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288

Look what a Bush speech writer has to say: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are excessively shorn of power. 

If you read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History you will see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). It seems to me at some point non-conservative intellectuals and/or lying conservatives tried to generalize the arguments of conservatism to generalized change.

Since the philosophic definition of something shouldn't be created by only proponents of something, but also critics, - and the Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify generalized conservatism) includes criticisms - it seems reasonable to conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan House at worst.

*****
Incase anyone doesn’t want to read the David Frum piece here he is explicitly admitting that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The non-rich always outnumber the rich. Democracy enables the many to outvote the few: a profoundly threatening prospect to the few. If the few possess power and wealth, they may respond to this prospect by resisting democracy before it arrives—or sabotaging it afterward.

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

>One of Ziblatt’s sharpest insights was that the failure to build an effective conservative party left incumbent elites in Germany and elsewhere “too weak to say yes.” They could not join the democratic system. They could only resent and resist it.

*****



There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked or not clearly articulated. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and such status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.


In the world view of the actual conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from. The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights he is working against the aristocracy. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 


To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.


To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 

*****

While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.


A consequence of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality is that primary political goals are to do nothing when problems come up and to dismantle labor and consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral and inherently deserve punishment. They want the working class to get fucked by global warming. They want people to die from COVID19. Etc. OH LOOK, months after I first wrote this it turns out to be validated by conservatives themselves: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408


Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why do so many seem to dense? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them because being below them had made them immoral.


Absolutely everything conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict with good specificity what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


We also need to address popular definitions of conservatism (small c) which are personal responsibility and incremental change: neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues, especially incremental issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 


This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well well do 1500 families next month.


But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor.


The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't." 

Which is in line with the main body of my comment. Look: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yTwpBLzxe4U

The truth is actually

Its different because he's not some lazy brown welfare queen living in the slums.

It was never about the right to life for babies. It was always about telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies, and making sure they drive themselves into financial ruin with an unplanned pregnancy. You can't climb up the social ladder if you're stuck in the hood working minimum wage with a baby.

Meanwhile Trump is an esteemed white man with blond hair. He works hard everyday doing important things for the nation like watching Fox in bed or tweeting bullshit all night. He is definitely much more deserving of the benefits of abortions than normal people.

Even if they stopped creating more bills now, and every single one was challenged by the States or by Democrats, how many do you think they would actually win? 10%? 5%? How many bills are going to get heard by Federalist Society hackjob-judges that McConnell was installing for the last 4 years? How many are going to get heard by a majority Conservative Supreme Court?

Just a couple of those voter suppression measures succeeding in key Counties or battleground States and you have a very different outcome in the 2022 midterms and 2024 general election.

GOP doesn't need to pull back from their race to the bottom so long as 79 million Americans still vote for their Candidate, or they gerrymander and restrict the hell out of your constitutional right to vote.

> it would be nice to not die or become egregiously disabled because I can’t pay for medical bills over something I had no control over getting.

**DEAR GOD, /s** *but this is an actual (paraphrased) answer I've heard given to a similar question:*

Well maybe getting the condition wasn't in your control, but paying your bills **is** in your control, so why should you get free healthcare when you can just earn it?  If you know you have high medical expenses you need to work harder to get a job that can pay for them.

No fren no /s because I'd be willing to wager that 9/10 billionaires or even millionaires wouldn't know what hard work was if it swam up and bit them on the ass. 

I only say that because I have worked for several very wealthy families. One family started Ryan Air, the commuter class airline in Ireland and the richest family started several oil and natural gas companies. The richest family was worth 9 billion dollars and made $25,000 per minute. Most of his family couldn't figure out how to wrap Christmas gifts, being serious about that too because I spent Christmas with them and had to show them how to wrap presents. The richer you are the less you do for yourself so therefore I think your brain starts to atrophy or something like that.

The thing everyone needs to understand is that conservatism is basically the politics of keeping the non-aristocrats in their place. Veteran are just poors and cattle to conservatives. 


Conservatism is the political movement to protect aristocracy (intergenerational wealth and political power) which we now call oligarchs, and enforce social hierarchy. This hierarchy involves a morality centered around social status such that the aristocrat is inherently moral (an extension of the divinely ordained king) and the lower working class is inherently immoral. The actions of a good person are good. The actions of a bad person are bad. The only bad action a good person can take is to interfere with the hierarchy. All conservative groups in all times and places are working to undo the French Revolution, democracy, and working class rights.

Populist conservative voter groups are created and controlled with propaganda. They wish to subjugate their local peers and don’t see the feet of aristocrats kicking them too.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and therefore deserve punishment.

*****
Most of the rest of the examples are American, but conservatism is the same mission in all times and places. 

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ To paraphrase: “Democracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.”

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized “change.”

The philosophic definition of something should include criticism. The Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify small c conservatism) includes criticisms. Involving those we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don’t want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political party is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. One prior attempt at rebuttal blocked me when we got to: why is it that specifically Conservative parties align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you’ll often see “rules for thee and not for me.” The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a non-conservative would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc.

OH LOOK, months after I first wrote this it turns out to be validated by conservatives themselves: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408

Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them for the immorality. 

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict with good specificity what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


We need to address more familiar definitions of conservatism (small c) which are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we’ll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 

The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people of lower in the hierarchy don’t.”

Conservatism (big C) has always had one goal and little c general conservatism is a myth. Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing others down to create an under class. In support of that is a morality based on a person’s inherent status as good or bad - not actions. Of course the thing that determines if someone is good or bad is whether they inhabit the aristocracy.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and deserve punishment.

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc.

OH LOOK, months after I first wrote this it turns out to be validated by conservatives themselves: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408

Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them for the immorality. 

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict with good specificity what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


We still need to address more familiar definitions of conservatism (small c) which are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we’ll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't."

Lindsey Graham’s Alleged Attempt to Toss Georgia Ballots Is Felony Election Fraud
---
And they are the current political representation of conservatism. Let's explore conservatism so we can understand why they don't think Graham or Trump are doing anything wrong here.

Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing everyone else down the ladder to create an under class. Secondary to that is a morality based on a person’s status as good or bad rather than their actions.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4CI2vk3ugk 


https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html

Look what a Bush2 speech writer has to say: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are excessively shorn of power.”

If you read here https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History you will see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). It seems to me at some point non-conservative intellectuals and/or lying conservatives tried to generalize the arguments of conservatism to generalized change.

Since the philosophic definition of something shouldn't be created by only proponents of something, but also critics, - and the Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify generalized conservatism) includes criticisms - it seems reasonable to conclude generalized conservatism is a myth at best and a Trojan House at worst.


*****
There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked or not clearly articulated. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and such status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.


In the world view of the actual conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from. The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights he is working against the aristocracy.


If we extend analysis to the voter base: Conservatives view other conservatives as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things.


To them Donald Trump is a good person. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.


To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor. Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things.


While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.


A consequence of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality is that primary political goals are to do nothing when problems come up and to dismantle labor and consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral and inherently deserve punishment. They want the working class to get fucked by global warming. They want people to die from COVID19. Etc.


Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why do so many seem to dense? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them because being below them had made them immoral.


Absolutely everything conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above.


*****


We also need to address popular definitions of conservatism which are personal responsibility and incremental change: neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues, especially incremental issues.


This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well well do 1500 families next month.


But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor.


The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't." 

Which is in line with the main body of my comment. Look: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yTwpBLzxe4U

And I don't even work for a right-wing think tank.  This is an easy one for the true believers to dismiss.  What won't be as easy to dismiss, and the reason so many don't believe in these policies, is the reality of living under these conditions.   This is why instead of just selling the theory it has to be coupled with a impediment.  Not just trickle-down will do anymore.  Now it is trickle-down and immigrants are stopping you from getting yours.  Or Democrats.  Or people on welfare.  People know they aren't getting theirs so a scapegoat must be created.

The Trumps are aristocratic. People who work for them are less than human in their eyes. 

Conservatism (big C) has always had one goal and little c general conservatism is a myth. Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing others down to create an under class. In support of that is a morality based on a person’s inherent status as good or bad - not actions. Of course the thing that determines if someone is good or bad is whether they inhabit the aristocracy.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and deserve punishment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4CI2vk3ugk 

https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html

Part of this is posted a lot: https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 I like the concept of Conservatism vs. anything else.

*****

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.”

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized “change.”

The philosophic definition of something shouldn't be created by only adherents, but also critics, - and the Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify small c conservatism) includes criticisms - so we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don’t want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political party is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. One prior attempt at rebuttal blocked me when we got to: why is it that specifically Conservative parties align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you’ll often see “rules for thee and not for me.” The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc. 

Montage of McConnell laughing at suffering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTqMGDocbVM&ab_channel=HuffPost

OH LOOK, months after I first wrote this it turns out to be validated by conservatives themselves: https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408

Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them for the immorality. 

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict with good specificity what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


We still need to address more familiar definitions of conservatism (small c) which are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we’ll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't."

I think education has less to do with it. HK education didn't cover "how to put out tear gas cannisters with a traffic cone". At the end of the day it's just HK Protestors generally show more restraint relatively. Arson shouldn't be a  national contest, but in terms of that, HK is severely lacking than ppl in Minneapolis. We didn't torch a police station ablaze at any point during the movement. We did set a guy on fire tho so we kinda beat Minneapolis in that department.

Edit: the guy that was set on fire was a civilian that got into an verbal argument with protestors, not police. So yeah... try and out-do us, Minneapolis...

As a Leftist who also owns a Scary Black Gun... I didn't make the decision to buy one until June 2020. Because right wing provocateurs tried to run over protestors at 3 different BLM protests within 2 miles of my house.  I knew it was only going to get worse as the election approached, and it became *manifestly obvious* that none of the layers of law enforcement in this country were willing to actually protect the people who needed it.

These types of bans will either be for cosmetic features (ignoring actual functionality), or will include a laundry list of specific models -- which will be incomplete, and need to be updated as needed. (As you say: ban AR-15s? Cool, I can get an AR-10 platform from Oracle even cheaper. Good job everyone!)

The problem is: the people who are most knowledgeable about guns won't join the gun control conversation on purely ideological grounds. So we're trapped in this tug-of-war until one side or another gets an unassailable majority, and uses it to pass laws that make no sense (e.g. either constitutional carry laws, or poorly written gun control laws).

This is a brilliant strategy. One of the few ways to turn losing election into a win is to pick your voters. Either through gerrymandering or through voter suppression, or both. This will insure false representation in government.

But they told us this would be done when the weather warms up, we'd be able to attend Easter Church services and this is no different than the flu which during some years causes 60k+ deaths.

Graduated from UT Austin in the mid 90's and only had about 15K in student debt when I exited. Each college hour at that time was $25. Literally paid more for books and materials each semester than tuition - and that's what most of the debt was from.

Fast forward to today and each hour at UT is literally an order of magnitude more. But hey, we have a newly remodeled stadium and one of the world's largest jumbotrons so I'm sure current students totally think it's worth the massive ass-rape for tuition these days!   /s just in case

I commented this elsewhere a few months back, but been trying to share this story around when I can;

>Story time: I got "tricked into going to a Drag bar(?) & I've never really known where or how to share this story but I'm gonna leave it here,

>A few years ago, when I had just started getting into doing stand-up. I was traveling 60-70 minutes a night just to go up at 2-4 open mics a week while running around the city. One night a few years ago, before Covid. I was talking to a couple of other comedians from the city. About how I was wasting like $40 just in gas just to do open mics at bars im buying drinks at to go up. I'm from Maine and the comedy scene just wasn't great at the time for unexperienced comedians like myself.

>The two of em' mentioned they actually knew a club that was super popular and did open mics once a week near me. I was so excited. That night I went & saved it my GPS. I then went up to the bar to do a set that week.

>What they failed to tell me, is that not only is this not a comedy bar. It's a **Drag show bar**. One for gay/trans(?) men & women to come & express themselves freely. The open mic? Was for the drag shows and other people to perform.

>Now. To be fair. I should have clocked something when I saw the line of incredibly handsome women lined out the door.. but this is Maine, & I own a mirror. So who am I to judge? /s 

>The second I walked in though. I could tell someone had played a 'prank' on me. This was no comedy club.

>I was actually gonna leave. I felt a bit shocked. I'm from a small town, and I had never been in that type of environment before. It felt like I didn't belong. I must of had *that* look on my face too. Cuz as I went to leave, this incredibly kind wo(man)(?)(I don't know the correct vocabulary, I'm sorry) came up to me. Making a harmless comment about this being my "first time" then invited me to have a drink with them at the bar.

>I tried to explain to them that I thought this was a comedy club. That a couple guys from Boston had "tricked" me into coming to this drag bar. As a straight guy I didn't think I belonged at a club like this. Not because I thought it was like, gross. Just that I felt like this was a safe space for the LGBTQIA+ community. And i'm not one of the vowels. I'm an S.

>They looked me confused, a bit sad. Saying essentially "That's exactly the attitude we don't allow here". I was scared. I thought I was about to get my first #MeToo.. But what she actually meant is that if I want to have a good time, then stay, & have a good time. No one there was gonna judge me because of my gender, race, sexuality, etc.

>And you know what? They were right. I stayed. & I'm **so. damn. happy.** I did. I had a few drinks. I danced a little (I never do that). I even got hit on for the first time at bar in my life (that never happens).

>Everyone there was so inclusive. They wanted everyone to have fun. It was like outside of the club they faced persecution & bigotry. But inside they felt free & safe. This is something I had never experienced in my life. It didn't magically *turn me gay*. They didn't 'slip me the magic fairy potion'. But being in this environment did make me happier. It's one of the most joyous nights of my life.

>This is what Republicans, MAGA, & people like this shooter want to take away. This happiness. This sense of belonging. To feel safe in their own space. Selfishly now that I've experienced it. How could I ever allow or be comfortable seeing it ripped away from others?

>Thanks to whoever read this!! I don't really know why I'm sharing this story, & I'm sorry if the details are a bit muddy I wrote this out just now. I'm also sorry if it's the wrong kinda story share or if I'm wrong.

Replace MAGA/shooter with Desantis/lawmakers & I still think this exact same sentiment applies. Just the tiniest amount of inclusion can make a worlds difference.

Gotta remember that Republicans want Hierarchy over all other things. 

Everyone can't just 'get along' and 'be friends' and 'be kind' if they aren't respecting the Obvious Social Order that places me above them as a good, God-Fearing Christian! And because they don't even TRY to be like me, They're threatening the Obvious Social Order by preteneding it doesn't exist!

"I watch these pundits on television and, you know, they call them intellectuals. They're not intellectuals," Trump told thousands of supporters in the swing state. "I'm much smarter than them. I think [I have a much higher IQ](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-i-have-a-higher-iq-than-george-will/article/2577023). I think I went to a better college — better everything,"

“He’s been quite critical of you as you know. He’s attacked you for being ignorant,” Piers Morgan said to Trump.  “[Let’s do an IQ test](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/05/16/trump-challenges-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-iq-test/84436936/),” Trump interrupted

"We can’t let these people, these so called egg-heads--and by the way, [I guarantee you my IQ is much higher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/10/a-brief-history-of-trump-challenging-people-to-iq-tests/) than theirs, alright.

I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,” Trump told Fox News last December.

Trump says he has "[one of the great memories of all time](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/25/trump_says_myeshia_johnson_s_recollection_is_wrong_and_he_has_one_of_the.html)"

 Asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” who he talks with consistently about foreign policy, Trump responded, “I’m speaking with myself, number one, because [I have a very good brain](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/trump-foreign-policy-adviser-220853) and I’ve said a lot of things."

I'm glad you posted that.  I saw the photo yesterday and I was like, "Yeah, that looks pretty bad, but they'll just pull the 'it was taken out of context' thing."  Then I saw the video.  I have never seen him look so beaten down and genuinely upset.  I really think that's the first time I've seen genuine emotion besides shit-eating smirk and spit-flecked rage on his face.  He almost looks human.  It doesn't make me empathize at all, but you can tell he's not happy.

Though, I suppose that once the cameras were off of him he did a little jump with a heel-kick, a little Willy Wonka roll, then ran into the White House full speed and spiked his MAGA hat in celebration while they dumped diet Coke and burgers on him out of a golden trophy or something.

This is just shitting all over everyone and everything, and insisting that you're morally right and deserve to be rewarded.

Now, we need multiple degrees, less and less manufacturing has forced people into few cities decimating small tows and causing sprawl, infrastructure has fallen apart, house prices are through the roof, both parents need to work, and each needs to work 60-80 hours a week. Yay progress /s

Not many counties did it because it was so clearly supported by voters but I suspect this will be the next move in Kansas by the GOP.

Romney is a conservative.  No need to add principled if you know what that means.  

Conservatism (big C) has always had one goal and little c general conservatism is a myth. Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing others down to create an under class. In support of that is a morality based on a person’s inherent status as good or bad - not actions. Of course the thing that determines if someone is good or bad is whether they inhabit the aristocracy.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and deserve punishment.

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.”

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized “change.”

The philosophic definition of something shouldn't be created by only adherents, but also critics, - and the Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify small c conservatism) includes criticisms - so we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don’t want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political party is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. One prior attempt at rebuttal blocked me when we got to: why is it that specifically Conservative parties align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you’ll often see “rules for thee and not for me.” The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc.

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict with good specificity what a conservative political actor will do. 


*****


We still need to address more familiar definitions of conservatism (small c) which are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we’ll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't."

 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't."

His response is sketchy in other ways too.

He told the NYT that he was informed by the DOJ that he was merely the subject of, and not the target of, the investigation.

This is a distinction with very little difference. A target is basically a person that you hope to indict by the end of the investigation from its outset. A subject of the investigation generally means there is evidence of your criminality uncovered during that investigation and that you could end up indicted. 

Either way, there is a very real chance that, even as a subject and not a target, a Grand Jury could be asked to consider evidence of and charges against Gaetz.

And that’s assuming he’s even telling the truth, which is a big assumption. Trying to spin this as being generous to ex girlfriends (which is laughable on its face) also suggests Gaetz is scrambling in his PR response.

So if that’s the best he can do to put out this media storm, he’s in bad shape. And it couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy! /s

Jonathan Swan reveals the simple secret to exposing Trump's lies: basic follow-up questions
---

But seriously, Swan was amazing in this interview. He let Trump rant just enough, but didn't let him take the conversation elsewhere, though he frequently tried. He wasn't too confrontational to upset Trump and have him walk out, but did not back down from follow-ups. 

Also, he noted that he's been covering Trump for 5 years now, and knew well enough to concede points and give Trump little pats on the back when he needed to just to keep Trump going. One example, Swan was trying to get Trump to talk about how his Tulsa rally likely led to a Covid spike in Oklahoma. Trump started ranting about how his crowd was twice the size that was reported and BLM was like an army outside the arena, not letting people in. After Trump incoherently rambled for a bit, Swan got him back on track. To paraphrase Swan, "Mr. President, I've been covering you for five years. I know you can draw crowds. I've been to your rallies. But I'm not questioning your ability to draw crowds, I'm asking about public health."

Brilliant.

It should be up to the states, but the federal government can withhold funding to force the state to capitulate so long as the funding is related to the policy goals. Louisiana held out on raising the drinking age to 21 until the US Highway administration withheld funds for road repair.

That’s because he’s joined the Aristocracy and gone all in on it. 

Conservatism (big C) has always had one goal and little c general conservatism is a myth. Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing others down to create an under class. In support of that is a morality based on a person’s inherent status as good or bad - not actions. Of course the thing that determines if someone is good or bad is whether they inhabit the aristocracy.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and deserve punishment.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4CI2vk3ugk 

https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html

Part of this is posted a lot: https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 I like the concept of Conservatism vs. anything else.

*****

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.”

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized “change.”

The philosophic definition of something shouldn't be created by only adherents, but also critics, - and the Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify small c conservatism) includes criticisms - so we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don’t want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political party is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. One prior attempt at rebuttal blocked me when we got to: why is it that specifically Conservative parties align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you’ll often see “rules for thee and not for me.” The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a non-conservative would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc.

Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them for the immorality. 

Absolutely everything Conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above. This is powerful because you can now predict with good specificity what a conservative political actor will do.

We still need to address more familiar definitions of conservatism (small c) which are a weird mash-up including personal responsibility and incremental change. Neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues. The only opposed change that really matters is the destruction of the aristocracy in favor of democracy. For some reason the arguments were white washed into a general “opposition to change.” 


 * This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


 * This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


 * We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well we’ll do 1500 families next month.


 * But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor. 

The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means “I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't."

That’s because the goal is hierarchy. 

Conservatism (big C) has always had one goal and little c “general” conservatism is a myth. Conservatism has the related goals of maintaining a de facto aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing outsiders down to enforce an under class. In support of that is a morality based on a person’s inherent status as good or bad - not their actions. The thing that determines if someone is good or bad is whether they inhabit the aristocracy.

Another way, Conservatives - those who wish to maintain a class system - assign moral value to people and not actions. Those not in the aristocracy are immoral and therefore deserve punishment.

Part of this is posted a lot: https://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/21/liberals-against-progressives/#comment-729288 I like the concept of Conservatism vs. anything else.

*****

A Bush speech writer takes the assertion for granted: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are overly shorn of power.”

Read here: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History and see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). At some point non-Conservative intellectuals and/or lying Conservatives tried to apply the arguments of conservatism to generalized “change.”

The philosophic definition of something should include criticism. The Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify small c conservatism) includes criticisms. Involving those we can conclude generalized conservatism (small c) is a myth at best and a Trojan Horse at worst.

*****
Incase you don’t want to read the David Frum piece here is a highlight that democracy only exists at the leisure of the elite represented by Conservatism. 

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

Conservatism, manifest as a political party is simply the effort of the Elites to maintain their privileged status. One prior attempt at rebuttal blocked me when we got to: why is it that specifically Conservative parties align with the interests of the Elite? 

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For Conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and the status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.

In the world view of the actual Conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from or all you’ll often see “rules for thee and not for me.” The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. Consider the divinely ordained king: he can do no wrong because he is king, because he is king at God’s behest. The anti-poor aristocratic elite still feel that way. 

This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights too much he is working against the aristocracy. 

*****

If we extend analysis to the voter base: conservative voters view other conservative voters as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things. It’s why Christians seem to ignore Christ. 

While a non-conservative would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.

To them Donald Trump is inherently a good person as a member of the aristocracy. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions so long as the aristocracy is being protected. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.

To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor (and the intrinsic moral state that matters is being part of the aristocracy). Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things. The one bad thing they can do is betray the class system. 


*****

The consequences of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality are the simple political goals to do nothing when problems arise and to dismantle labor & consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral, inherently deserve punishment, and certainly don’t deserve help. They *want* the working class to get fucked by global warming. They *want* people to die from COVID19. Etc.

> Sometimes I wonder if they even think beyond "they both broke something and I don't like them."

Not even that really. You might think there is some underlying system of internally consistent values that underpin all their utterances, but really it's just "these sounds were used derisively against me, I'm going to make those sounds to hurt them". There's no argument, not even a bad faith argument. It's just meat noises. Whatever "sounds good" in the moment, that's what flies out of their mouths.

Same thing with laws really. Because the laws exist, they dress up their despicable acts in terms of laws, but really it's just mafioso thug squads exerting their power over others. They use the law because it's a convenient cover for people not paying much attention, and they don't have to think much when confronted by the question "why".

Just like "values", these things exist to use a cudgels against the other. That's why claims of hypocrisy don't phase them. They have no values other than "I hate you". Even their slavish devotion to the accumulation of money and power can be explained through this framework. What good is having money if you can't have so much that you can harm others? It's not good enough just to have money, you have to have more than those people you hate. You have to have so much that you can force those others to degrade themselves for your pleasure.

Government study shows taxpayers are subsidizing “starvation wages” at McDonald's, Walmart. Sen. Bernie Sanders called the findings "morally obscene"

I absolutely can’t stand all the corporate welfare in this country because poor working stiffs aren’t afforded the same courtesy. Small and medium sized businesses are failing at a rapid pace and PPP money is going to wealthy corporations. It’s disgusting. 

After this election... I just can’t even any more.  I 
 honestly can’t believe how there are so many people so brainwashed slurping down Republican propaganda. If red states were a country they’d rank among some of the poorest countries in the world regarding infant mortality, teen birth rate and lack of educational attainment. What is their excuse any more? 

What’s 1200$ gonna do for me? That doesn’t even cover rent in the area I’m in. I’ve been in multiple different studios that cost more than that. Meanwhile these chuckle fucks in the senate are passing millions around in insider trading schemes riding the wave of old Donald’s Twitter meltdowns. The wealth is only accumulating more at the top every day. 

So what interest rates are at historic lows. Who the f cares when I can’t afford real estate. You lowered capital gains taxes??? Nobody in my fucking tax bracket is playing the stock market. I’m more likely to lose my job to downsizing than I am to get wealthy in this country and I have a degree... like everybody else.  

So what’s in it for me if I vote R? Seriously. Socialism would be a MASSIVE boost to my chances. Huge. People are afraid the big bad democrats are gonna cancel student loans but I’d save $40k if they did that tomorrow. Afraid of immigration? I WISH they would relax things a bit so farms could find the cheapest labor they can so my grocery bills weren’t so outrageous. I pay at least 250-300 every month just to feed myself and I cook at home for every meal except Sunday’s where I get a medium fucking pizza. 

I duno man. Every time I even consider the idea of voting for a Republican who wants to torch social safety nets and send us back to the dark ages I vomit in my mouth a little. Medicare for all? Omfg. Gimme some more of that sweet sweet socialism. If I wasn’t hostage to my employer’s health plan I’d be 1,000,000% more likely to start the bakery I’ve always dreamed of having. Owning a business is only for “successful businessmen” like Donald Trump apparently /s

We learn it in poli sci 103 which has the prerequisite of 101 and 102, because typically by the time someone is done with introductory classes in the leftist institution of colleges that recognize science where students have to cite their claims they are no longer republican if they entered republican.  Some republicans may make it that far, but 103 starts with a bunch of really heavy talk about systemic racism and transgender/queer and gender identity/rights conversations so the ones who were left drop the optional class quickly.  

The rest of the semester is purely about how to cheat elections and get away with it, but for some reason we never do a good enough job to actually win enough to do what we want to do.  Like we got 3 million mexicans on buses into the country to vote in 2016 (shout out to soros. Soros hive. Gang gang, ah ah ah), but we couldn't get people to vote in michigan or florida? We gotta work on logistics.

The progressives shall rise up!

42% of Voters Say Trump Will Be Known as 'One of Worst' Presidents in History: Fox News Poll
---
Under Andrew Jackson 4 to 5000 people died during the Trail of Tears.  For any president during a pandemic there would have been many deaths but because of trumps utter inept handling of Covid we now have 300,000 dead Americans.   Even giving trump a lot of slack, probably less than half of those dead are a result of his science denying stupidity. In 2019 trump was ranked by conservative political historians across the country at 3rd and 4th from the bottom of all presidents.  Middle of the road and left leaning political historians ranked him dead last. This ranking was before Covid hit.  The combination of his coup attemps and the massive death rate, I have little doubt that he will be ranked as the worst president in US history and probably one of the worst leaders of any western democracy
 EVER!                  And aren't we lucky to be living during all this insanity.  /s

Edit to add:  Obama was ranked 14th by conservative historians and 8th by more liberal historians.

it's not even that.  it's that what's in The Bible (and really not even all the material there) is the most important stuff to know, if not **the only stuff** that's important to know.

After all, The Bible came from ***GOD HIMSELF*** and anything else merely came from imperfect, non-omniscient, mortal-and-eventually-dead humans. So, "stick with the stuff that will always be true, coming from the being who was always there & will always be there, the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End"

He went down the rabbit hole and started talking about mathematicians who identified fraud etc....yet ignores the rulings of stuff that goes to court, saying they need time to build the case for something this big...how the hell do I rescue this dude? Anything I can do to properly educate him on election security and process and the lack of evidence of fraud? (He's currently following the accusation that votes were switched....smh)

Opinion: With Justice Ginsburg’s death, Mitch McConnell’s nauseating hypocrisy comes into full focus

Did anyone really believe his belief that presidents should not be nominating supreme court justices in their last year of office would cut both ways?

No. He might as well have said "we're not going to allow a LIBERAL president another chance to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. We still do what we want."

McConnell [has insisted](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/mcconnell-supreme-court-2020/590452/) that the precedent he created in denying former President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland in the final year of Obama’s term—to fill a vacancy that occurred nearly nine months before the 2016 election—no longer applies, *because the same party controls both the White House and the Senate majority*.

I would have gone with the fact that at the time of the Garland appointment, Obama was leaving office no matter what, his 2 terms in office were essentially over.

Trump has only completed one term, and is seeking another, and another  so that's got to count for something? amirite? **AMIRITE? /s**

And if your would-be removers are both the majority and highly party-over-country-loyal, they *will vote party line* regardless of the evidence. So, while not inconsequential, no, this Impeachment did not lead to removal. It was, arguably, still the necessary and the right thing to move forward with. The witnesses and the evidence for the trial *was* after all, available.

If anyone has forgotten ^because ^it ^feels ^like ^at ^least ^three ^years ^ago ^wtf, the Senate majority party had openly confessed to having premeditated their votes before the trial had even begun. Ultimately that rendered the Impeachment a presidential qualifier only—albeit valid and irrevocable—but was otherwise as shammy a “trial” as any other totally low-key, totally not-internationally-televised, shammy trial. And thus there was no reason to allow new evidence or witnesses... /s

Then COVID-19. Then like 42 other things jammed in there. *And then,* George Floyd’s murder by *multiple* LEOs is caught on camera—footage goes viral setting off a massive response. Then Trump’s response. And now we’re *in* real time with protests all over the country. Movements are happening, biological and social. Hope all this finally moves his fatass outta the WH!

It’s impeachable. It’s likely illegal. It’s a coup.

Baffling evidence shows up of what we all have been suspecting for a while: the treasonous President of the United States trying to overturn democracy in a coup attempt by directly pressuring officials speaking like an experienced mob boss.

WaPo: dunno, likely illegal?

What are you all worshipping your constitution for in the 'land of the free', telling yourselves that you need unbridled capitalism, guns and the right to be openly racist to prevent some hypothetical tyrannical government from taking hold (like everywhere here in Europe /s), meanwhile a genuine coup attempt takes place you are like 'better not call it a coup not to hurt rightist feelings' and 'oh we didn't expect something like this could happen, I bet we must have some obscure law somewhere which doesn't allow this.' 

It genuinely puzzles me how the country which is built on a religious belief in freedom and preventing an authoritarian regime to establish itself, is so indifferent when that seems to be actually happening and so unable to do something against it.

GOP Senator Kept Coronavirus Info Secret for Weeks, But Shared It With Wealthy Donors

> On Wednesday, President Donald Trump activated his vast store of emergency powers under the Defense Production Act of 1950.

> This act, previously explored in depth by Law&Crime here, affords the president nearly unlimited coercive economic powers during a crisis implicating the national defense.
> 
> Those powers are so broad and so vast that attorney Tor Ekeland dubbed the underlying statute “a socialist military relic from a time of global warfare and the Red Scare.”
> 
> Ekeland said the use of those powers should be a concern because the wartime statute confers “monarchical powers than what should be the more limited powers of a president under our constitutional system.”

It’s important for people to understand what conservatism is and how it’s voter base thinks. 

Conservatism has the singular goal of maintaining an aristocracy that inherits political power and pushing everyone else down the ladder to create an under class. Secondary to that is a morality based on a person’s status as good or bad rather than their actions.


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4CI2vk3ugk 


https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html

Look what a Bush speech writer has to say: It's all about the upper class vs. democracy. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/06/why-do-democracies-fail/530949/ “Democracy fails when the Elites are excessively shorn of power.”

And a more philosophical approach https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ 

If you read here https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/ and here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#History you will see that all of the major thought leaders in Conservatism have always opposed one specific change (democracy at the expense of aristocratic power). It seems to me at some point non-conservative intellectuals and/or lying conservatives tried to generalize the arguments of conservatism to generalized change.

Since the philosophic definition of something shouldn't be created by only proponents of something, but also critics, - and the Stanford page (despite taking pains to justify generalized conservatism) includes criticisms - it seems reasonable to conclude generalized conservatism is a myth at best and a Trojan House at worst.

*****

There is a key difference between conservatives and others that is often overlooked or not clearly articulated. For liberals, actions are good, bad, moral, etc and people are judged based on their actions. For conservatives, people are good, bad, moral, etc and such status of the person is what dictates how an action is viewed.


In the world view of the actual conservative leadership - those with true wealth or political power - , the aristocracy is moral by definition and the working class is immoral by definition and deserving of punishment for that immorality. This is where the laws don't apply trope comes from. The aristocracy doesn't need laws since they are inherently moral. This is also why people can be wealthy and looked down on: if Bill Gates tries to help the poor or improve worker rights he is working against the aristocracy.


If we extend analysis to the voter base: Conservatives view other conservatives as moral and good by the state of being labeled conservative because they adhere to status morality and social classes. It's the ultimate virtue signaling. They signal to each other that they are inherently moral. It’s why voter base conservatives think “so what” whenever any of these assholes do nasty anti democratic things.


To them Donald Trump is a good person. The conservative isn’t lying or being a hypocrite or even being "unfair" because - and this is key - for conservatives past actions have no bearing on current actions and current actions have no bearing on future actions. Lindsey Graham is "good" so he says to delay SCOTUS confirmations that is good. When he says to move forward: that is good.


To reiterate: All that matters to conservatives is the intrinsic moral state of the actor. Obama was intrinsically immoral and therefore any action on his part was “bad.” Going further - Trump, or the media rebranding we call Mitt Romney, or Moscow Mitch are all intrinsically moral and therefore they can’t do “bad” things.


While a liberal would see a fair or moral or immoral action and judge the person undertaking the action, a conservative sees a fair or good person and applies the fair status to the action. To the conservative, a conservative who did something illegal or something that would be bad on the part of someone else - must have been doing good. Simply because they can’t do bad.


A consequence of the central goal of conservatism and the corresponding actor state morality is that primary political goals are to do nothing when problems come up and to dismantle labor and consumer protections. The non-aristocratic are immoral and inherently deserve punishment. They want the working class to get fucked by global warming. They want people to die from COVID19. Etc.


Why do the conservative voters seem to vote against their own interest? Why do so many seem to dense? Why does /selfawarewolves and /leopardsatemyface happen? They simply think they are higher on the social ladder than they really are and want to punish those below them because being below them had made them immoral.


Absolutely everything conservatives say and do makes sense when applying the above.


*****


We also need to address popular definitions of conservatism which are personal responsibility and incremental change: neither of those makes sense applied to policy issues, especially incremental issues.


This year a few women can vote, next year a few more, until in 100 years all women can vote?


This year a few kids can stop working in mines, next year a few more...


We should test the waters of COVID relief by sending a 1200 dollar check to 500 families. If that goes well well do 1500 families next month.


But it’s all in when they want to separate migrant families to punish them. It’s all in when they want to invade the Middle East for literal generations. 


The incremental change argument is asinine. It’s propaganda to avoid concessions to labor.


The personal responsibility argument falls apart with the whole "keep government out of my medicare thing." Personal responsibility just means I deserve free things, but people more poor than me don't." 

Which is in line with the main body of my comment. Look: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yTwpBLzxe4U

And for anyone that doesn’t want to click a link here is what David Frum conservative operative and former bush speech writer says. 

>The non-rich always outnumber the rich. Democracy enables the many to outvote the few: a profoundly threatening prospect to the few. If the few possess power and wealth, they may respond to this prospect by resisting democracy before it arrives—or sabotaging it afterward.

>The most crucial variable predicting the success of a democratic transition is the self-confidence of the incumbent elites. If they feel able to compete under democratic conditions, they will accept democracy. If they do not, they will not.
And the single thing that most accurately predicts elite self-confidence, as Ziblatt marshals powerful statistical and electoral evidence to argue, is the ability to build an effective, competitive conservative political party before the transition to democracy occurs.

>One of Ziblatt’s sharpest insights was that the failure to build an effective conservative party left incumbent elites in Germany and elsewhere “too weak to say yes.” They could not join the democratic system. They could only resent and resist it.
